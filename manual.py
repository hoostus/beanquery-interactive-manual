    This is an interactive manual and tutorial for [beanquery](https://github.com/beancount/beanquery) — a customizable, extensible, lightweight SQL query tool for [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/) ledger data.

    This document is intended as a follow-up to the Beancount v2 [Beancount Query Language](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0GOZMcrKKCLlP29MD7kHO4L88evrwWdIO0p4EwRBE0/edit?usp=sharing) document.

    It was created with the following goals in mind:

    * to cover the latest features of beanquery
    * to include many real examples using actual ledgers
    * to be self-documenting: all query outputs are computed by running beanquery as part of the notebook execution
    * to be interactive: when run as a [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebook, readers can experiment by changing the default ledgers and/or queries, with outputs updating automatically

    This document assumes no prior knowledge of SQL and is structured as much as possible as a tutorial, where each chapter builds on the material covered in the previous ones. As a result, the material is more spread throughout the document than it would be if it were written for an SQL-familiar reader. For example, the available tables are introduced in one chapter, and more detailed information about some of them is added in several later chapters.

    This document is written as a [marimo](https://docs.marimo.io/) notebook. You can read it as a normal HTML document.
    However, the cool feature of this notebook is that if you run it as a marimo notebook, you can interact with the document by changing the default text for both the ledger and the query in all examples. As soon as an input widget loses focus, the query is re-executed and the output is updated.

    Both in HTML format and in the marimo notebook format, a clickable table of contents is available when hovering near the right side of the browser's vertical scroll bar.

    Note that throughout the document, unresolved questions the author had about beanquery functionality are marked with double question marks.

    E.g.: ?? Why do we need this.

    There are also some TODOs, marked with #TODO.

    Beanquery parses a Beancount ledger and creates an in-memory database represented as several tables. Beanquery then exposes a command-line tool that acts as a client to that in-memory database, where you can type queries in a variant of SQL.

    Beanquery started as an experiment in Beancount v2, but in v3 (when **bean-report** and **bean-web** were discontinued) it became practically the only tool for querying information from a Beancount ledger. Thus, one can say that in v3 Beancount has moved toward the [Self-service business intelligence](https://www.techtarget.com/searchbusinessanalytics/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI) model, instead of providing off-the-shelf ready-to-use reports.

    So one might ask: why create another SQL client? Why not output the data to an SQLite database and let the user use any SQL client? Apparently this experiment was conducted by creating [bean-sql](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/v2/beancount/scripts/sql.py). It turned out that writing queries was painful and carrying out operations on lots held at cost was difficult.

    Therefore beanquery has some extras that are essential for querying a Beancount ledger. These extras include (but are not necessarily limited to) the following:
    * The client supports the semantics of inventory booking implemented in Beancount. It also supports aggregation functions on inventory objects and rendering functions (e.g., COST() to render the cost of an inventory instead of its contents).
    * The client supports some functions that run on postings but in the background also access other tables (e.g. the CONVERT() function, which formally operates on amounts, positions, or inventories, but in the background also uses the prices table).
    * It allows filtering at two levels simultaneously: you can filter whole transactions, which has the benefit of respecting the accounting equation, and then, usually for presentation purposes, you can also filter at the posting level.
    * Objects in one table already have references to related objects in another table. For example, records in the postings table have a reference to their related transaction object. So one can say that these tables have already been pre-joined (even though technically this is not entirely correct).
    * Transactions can be summarized in a manner useful for producing balance sheets and income statements. For example, our SQL variant explicitly supports a “close” operation with an effect similar to year-end closing, which inserts transactions to clear income statement accounts to equity and removes past history.

    To run beanquery type

    ```shell
    bean-query [OPTIONS] FILENAME [QUERY]...
    ```

    This launches the query tool in interactive mode, where you can enter multiple commands on the dataset loaded in memory. Beanquery parses the input file, prints a few basic statistics about your ledger, and provides a command prompt for you to enter query commands.

    e.g.:

    ```shell
    bean-query  test.bean
    Input file: "Beancount"
    Ready with 3 directives (2 postings in 1 transactions, 0 validation errors)
    beanquery>
    ```

    If your ledger contains any errors, they are printed before the prompt.

    E.g.:

    ```shell
    PS C:\_code\bean> bean-query test.bean
    C:\_code\bean\test.bean:7: syntax error, unexpected ACCOUNT

    Input file: "Beancount"
    Ready with 8 directives (6 postings in 4 transactions, 1 validation errors)
    beanquery>
    ```

    You can also start beanquery as a python module

    ```shell
    python -m beanquery [OPTIONS] FILENAME [QUERY]...
    ```

    If you’d like to run queries directly from the command-line, without an interactive prompt, you can provide the query directly following your filename:

    ```shell
    $ bean-query myfile.beancount 'balances from year = 2014'
                         account                       balance

    The beanquery SELECT query loosely follows standard SQL syntax, with some deviations that will be discussed throughout this manual.

    It should be noted that originally **beanquery** was designed to extract information from the postings table only. In this situation the **FROM** part of the SQL query was "hijacked" for transaction-level filtering and **WHERE** was used for posting-level filtering, which introduced a so-called two-level filtering syntax:

    The SELECT query structure looked like this (written in the informal EBNF language):

    ```text
    SELECT [DISTINCT] [<targets>|*]
    [FROM <entry-filter-logical-expression> [OPEN ON <date>] [CLOSE [ON <date>]] [CLEAR]]
    [WHERE <posting-filter-logical-expression>]
    [GROUP BY <groups>]
    [ORDER BY <groups> [ASC|DESC]]
    [LIMIT num]
    ```

    Let us call it the **traditional SELECT query form**.

    /// details | **Note about the informal EBNF language**
        type: info

     In this manual, queries are described using a simplified notation that shows the structure of a command.

    This notation is based on an **informal version of Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF)**, but you do not need to know anything about EBNF to use it. It is designed to be easy to read and understand.

     Here is how to interpret it:

    * Words written in **UPPERCASE** are keywords that must be typed exactly as shown
    * Items in **square brackets `[ ... ]`** are optional
    * The symbol `|` means “or” (choose one of the alternatives)
    * Text inside **angle brackets `<...>`** is a placeholder — you replace it with your own value
    * Items written next to each other should be written in that order

    **Example:**

     ```sql
     SELECT [DISTINCT] <targets | * > [FROM <expression>]
     ```

    This means:

     * Start with `SELECT`
     * Optionally add `DISTINCT`
     * Either provide one or more targets (what you want to select) or put asterisks (*)
     * Then optionally put `FROM`, followed by some expression (expressions are discussed later)

    **In simple terms:**

    Think of this syntax as a **template** for writing queries:

    It shows what parts are required, what parts are optional, and where you need to insert your own values.

    Later, in Beancount v3, when beanquery was moved to a standalone tool, it was extended to query more tables (see above). In this situation the FROM part was needed again to select a table, so a new form of the SELECT query was introduced:

    ```text
    SELECT [DISTINCT] [<targets>|*]
    [FROM #<table-name>]
    [WHERE <posting-filter-logical-expression>]
    [GROUP BY <groups>]
    [ORDER BY <groups> [ASC|DESC]]
    [LIMIT num]
    ```
    Let us call it the **#table** query form.

    Note that:
    * The **#table** form is activated by adding the # symbol in front of the table name
    * The **#table** form allows querying tables other than the postings table, but when used to query the postings table (which is possible), it lacks some functionality available in the traditional form, namely the `[OPEN ON <date>] [CLOSE [ON <date>]] [CLEAR]` part. (This may actually be a [bug](https://github.com/beancount/beanquery/issues/274), rather than a feature.)

    So, to summarize:
    * In the traditional BQL, the FROM clause is used to describe the posting-level filter, not to identify the data source
    * In the **#table** syntax, the table name must be preceded by the # symbol
    * In BQL, using a wildcard as the target list (“*”) selects a sensible default set of columns, whereas in standard SQL, * selects the complete set of columns available in the table

    Currently beanquery supports both query types. Let us explore this with a simple ledger.

    The contents of a ledger is parsed into a list of directives, most of which are “Transaction” objects which contain two or more “Posting” objects. Postings are always linked only to a single transaction (they are never shared between transactions). Each posting refers to its parent transaction but has a unique account name, amount and associated lot (possibly with a cost), a price and some other attributes. The parent transaction itself contains a few useful attributes as well, such as a date, the name of a payee, a narration string, a flag, links, tags, etc.

    So, one can think that attributes such as **date** or **narration** belong to the transaction object, whilst attributes like **account** belong to the posting object. However (probably for simplicity) all of the transaction-level fields are also made available in the posting objects (the only exception being the transaction meta, which is not available from the posting). One can check this by comparing the outputs of the **`.describe postings`** and **`.describe transactions`** commands.

Access to the previous row is not a standard SQL feature, so we get a little creative and provide a special column called “balance” which is automatically calculated based on the previous selected rows. This provides the ability to render typical account statements such as those mailed to you by a bank. Output might look like this:

    The `SELECT` clause (and only the `SELECT clause`) allows usage of the called **Aggregate functions**, in addition to the ordinary Functions.
    The **Aggregate functions** operate on more than a single row. These functions aggregate and summarize the multiple values for the data column that they operate on.

    Examples of aggregate functions include:
    * `COUNT(...)`: Computes the number of postings selected (an integer).
    * `FIRST(...)`, `LAST(...)`: Returns first or last value seen.
    * `MIN(...)`, `MAX(...)`: Computes the minimum or maximum value seen.
    * `SUM(...)`: Sums up the values of each set. This works on amounts, positions, inventories, numbers, etc.

    A usage of at least one of the aggregate function turns a query into the **Aggregate Query**. An **Aggregate query** is a query, which produces a row of results for each group of postings that match the restricts in the `WHERE` clause.  In order to identify the aggregation keys in a **classical SQL** all the non-aggregate columns have to be flagged using the GROUP BY clause:

    The shell provides a few operators designed to facilitate the generation of balance sheets and income statements. The particular methodology used to define these operations should be described in detail in the [“introduction to double-entry bookkeeping”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/100tGcA4blh6KSXPRGCZpUlyxaRUwFHEvnz_k9DyZFn4/edit?usp=sharing) document that accompanies Beancount and is mostly located in the source code in the [summarize](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/master/beancount/ops/summarize.py) module.
    These special operators are provided on the FROM clause that is made available on the various forms of query commands in the shell. These further transform the set of entries selected by the FROM expression at the transaction levels (not postings).
    Please note that these are not from standard SQL; these are extensions provided by this shell language only.

    `JOURNAL <account-regexp> [AT <function>] [FROM …]`

    The regular expression account-regexp is used to select which subset of accounts to generate a journal for. The optional `AT <function>` clause is used to specify an aggregation function for the amounts rendered (typically `UNITS` or `COST`).

    The other most common type of report is a table of the balances of various accounts at a particular date. This can be viewed as a SELECT query aggregating positions grouping by account.
    You can generate a balances report with the following syntax:

    `BALANCES [AT <function>] [FROM …]`

    The optional `AT <function>` clause is used to specify an aggregation function for the balances rendered (usually UNITS or COST). The `FROM` clause follows the same rules as for the SELECT statement and is optional.
    To generate your balances at a particular date, close your set of entries using the `FROM… CLOSE ON` form described above.

    Observe that typical balance sheets and income statements seen in an accounting context are subsets of tables of balances such as reported by this query. An income statement reports on just the transactions that appears during a period of time, and a balance sheet summarizes transactions before its reporting before and clears the income & expenses accumulated during the period to an equity account. Then some minor reformatting is carried out. Please consult the introduction document on double-entry bookkeeping for more details, and the section above that discusses the “open”, “close” and “clear” operations.

    It can be useful to generate output in Beancount format, so that subsets of transactions can be saved to files, for example. The shell provides that ability via the PRINT command:

    `
    PRINT [FROM …]
    `

    The FROM clause obeys the usual semantics as described elsewhere in this document. The resulting filtered stream of Beancount entries is then printed out on the output in Beancount syntax.
    In particular, just running the `PRINT` command will spit out the parsed and loaded contents of a Beancount file. You can use this for troubleshooting if needed, or to expand transactions generated from a plugin you may be in the process of developing.
