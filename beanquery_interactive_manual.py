    Beancount’s parsed list of entries is like an in-memory database represented in a form of several tables. Beanquery is a command-line tool that acts like a client to that in-memory database in which you can type queries in a variant of SQL. You invoke it like this:

    ```shell
    bean-query  test.bean
    Input file: "Beancount"
    Ready with 3 directives (2 postings in 1 transactions, 0 validation errors)
    beanquery>
    ```
    Beanquery started as an experiment in beancount v2, but in v3 (when **bean-report** and **bean-web** have been discontinued) became practically the only tool to query information out of beancount ledger. Thus one can say, that in v3 beancount has moved towards the [Self-service business intelligence](https://www.techtarget.com/searchbusinessanalytics/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI) model instead of providing off the shelf ready to use reports.

    Originally **beanquery** was designed to be use to query postings table only. In this situation the **FROM** part of the SQL query was "hijacked" to be used for transaction-level filtering and **WHERE** was used for posting-level filtering, which introduced so-called  two-level filtering syntax

    So, the SELECT query structure looked like this:

    The contents of a ledger is parsed into a list of directives, most of which are “Transaction” objects which contain two or more “Posting” objects. Postings are always linked only to a single transaction (they are never shared between transactions). Each posting refers to its parent transaction but has a unique account name, amount and associated lot (possibly with a cost), a price and some other attributes. The parent transaction itself contains a few useful attributes as well, such as a date, the name of a payee, a narration string, a flag, links, tags, etc.

    So, one can think, that such attribute as **date** or **narration** belong to transaction object, whilst attributes like **account** belongs to posting object. However (at least in the latest version of beanquery) all of the transaction-level fields are also made avaiable in the posting objects (only exeption being the transaction meta, which is not available from the posting). One can check this by comparing the outputs of the **`.describe postings`** and **`.describe transactions`** commands.
