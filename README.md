# Interactive beanquery manual

This is an interactive manual and tutorial for [beanquery](https://github.com/beancount/beanquery) — a customizable, extensible, lightweight SQL-like query tool for [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/) ledger data.

This document is intended as a follow-up to the Beancount v2 [Beancount Query Language](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0GOZMcrKKCLlP29MD7kHO4L88evrwWdIO0p4EwRBE0/edit?usp=sharing) document.

It was created with the following goals in mind:

* to cover the latest features of beanquery
* to include many real examples using actual ledgers
* to be self-documenting: all query outputs are computed by running beanquery as part of the notebook execution
* to be interactive: when run as a [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebook, readers can experiment by changing the default ledgers and/or queries, with outputs updating automatically

**Current state**: work is ongoing. 
Comments, feedback and PRs are more then welcome!
