The **Interactive beanquery manual** is using the `develop` branch for development.
Therefore a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) needs to be created gainst the `develop` branch, as this branch may be significantly ahead of the `main` branch, which is published to the [GitHib Pages](https://ev2geny.github.io/beanquery-interactive-manual/)

These are simple steps to do this

1. Create your own Fork of the **Interactive beanquery manual** following [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).<br>Note: do not select the **Copy the DEFAULT branch only** option, when creating a fork.

2. If not done yet, install uv for your OS, following the [official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
3. Clone this directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your-directory>/beanquery-interactive-manual.git

   cd beanquery-interactive-manual
   ```
4. Switch to the `develop` branch
   
   ```
   git switch develop
   ```

5. Run the notebook in the edit mode:
   ```
   uv run marimo edit manual.py
   ```
6. Make and save desired changes to the notebook.  When making changes, follow these rules:
   * if new section(s) and hence new heading(s) added, to not renumber existing headings and do not add numbering to a new heading
  
7. Commit changes to the git repository
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "your commit message goes here"
   ```
8. Push changes back to github
   ```
   git push
   ```
9.  Create a pull request from your fork to the `develop` branch following [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
